# ADGraph: A graph-Based Approach to Ad and Tracker Blocking

<https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9152669&tag=1>

- A graph-based machine learning approach for detecting advertising and tracking resources
  - Builds a graph representation of HTML structure, network requests, and JS behavior
  - Considers the context a network request takes place in
- Domain Based Blocking
  - Prevent advertising and tracking by identifying suspect domains, and blocking all requests to resources on such domains
  - Countermeasures:
    - Fails as a result of Domain Generation Algorithms that randomize domains
    - Also circumvented by proxying the malicious resource through the first-party domain.
- JavaScript Code Unit Classification
  - Identify undesirable code based on the structure or behavior of JS code units
    - Take a single code unit as an input, train ML classifiers for identifying
  - Countermeasures:
    - Does not consider the interactions between code units, easily circumvented by dividing up code units to the smallest susceptible behavior
    - If looking at static features, such as names of cookie values, are vulnerable to obfuscation techniques
- JavaScript Attribution Approaches
  - Need to associate code units to DOM modifications. Without knowing the source of the modification, how can you block it?
  - JS Stack Walking
    - Most common
    - Interpose on the prototype chain of the methods observed, throw an exception, walk the resulting stack object to determine what code unit called the modified method.
    - Allows for runtime policy decisions
    - Faults in this Design:
      - Many cases where calling code can mask its identity from the stack, making attribution impossible
        - Eval‚Äôed code and inlined functions by JS runtime
      - Requires that code be able to modify prototype objects, which requires the attributing code to run before any other code on the page.

## ADGraph Design

- Take the DOM tree, contextualize it by including information about execution and communication of the page
  - Edges to captures JS interactions with HTML elements, or which code unit triggered a given network request
  - Edges turn the tree into a graph
- The graph representation of a webpage tracks changes in the websites HTML structure, network requests, and JS behavior
- This Graph approach brings some benefits:
  - Cause & Content of network requests & DOM modification: the graph allows for tracing the origin of any change or behavior back to the responsible JS code unit.
  - Allows for extraction of context-rich features, which is used to identify tracking related network requests
    - Ex. Determinations of the source script sending an AJAX request, the position/depth/location of an image request, and if a subdocument was injected into a page from JS code

### Graph representation

- Nodes: All elements are 1 of 4 types of nodes
  - Parser ‚Äì attributes document changes and network requests to the HTML parser, instead of script execution. Each graph has one parser node.
  - HTML ‚Äì HTML elements in the page. Ex. Image tags, anchor tags, paragraph tags. Annotated with info about tag type and HTML attributes (src, class, value). Text nodes do not have a type.
  - Network ‚Äì Remote resources. Annotated with type of resource being requested (subdocuments/iframes, images, XMLHTTPRequest fetches, etc.)
  - Script ‚Äì Each compiled and executed body of JS code.
- Edges (Directed): The relationship between any two nodes. 3 types.
  - May have cycles
  - Structural ‚Äì Relationship between two HTML elements (nodes). Inserted to represent parent-child node relationships and order of siblings.
    - HTML -> HTML
  - Modification ‚Äì Creation, insertion, removal, deletion, and attribute modification of each HTML node. Notes the type of event and other info such as the attribute modified, new values, etc.
    - Script -> HTML
  - Network ‚Äì Browser making request for a remote resource (network node). Annotated with the URL being requested
    - Script/HTML -> Network
- Examples:
  - Image src represented as HTML node ‚Äì (Network Edge)ü°™ Network node depicting the image
  - Script modifying the value of a form element
    - Script node ‚Äì(Modification Edge)ü°™ HTML node
    - Requires different approach to determine which script unite ‚Äúowned‚Äù any given execution.

## Feature Extraction

Features that ADGraph extracts to distinguish ads and trackers from functional resources

### Structural ‚Äì Features that consider the relationship between nodes and edges

Ex. Graph size, Modifications by scripts, etc.

- Whether a node‚Äôs parents have ad-related values for the class attribute, the tag names of node‚Äôs siblings, or how deeply nested in the DOM a given node is
- Also considers the interactions between JS code and the resource requested
  - Relies on chromium‚Äôs Blink and V8

### Content - Features that depend on the values and attributes of nodes in isolation from their connections

Ex. Request type, length of URL, Domain party, etc.

- Most significant value is the URL of resource requested

### Classification

Uses random forest, a well known ensemble supervised ML classification algorithm

- Combines decisions from multiple decision trees by choosing the mode of the predicted class distribution

3 categories of network requests

- Initiated by the HTML
- Initiated by a node‚Äôs attribute change
- Initiated directly by JS code

#### Most useful features in distinguishing between malicious and benign content

Structural Features

- Node‚Äôs average degree of connectivity
  - AD nodes are expected to have lower average degree of connectivity
  - Non-AD nodes are expected to have higher average degree of connectivity
  - This was found to be true ^
- Parents‚Äô attributes
  - AD nodes are expected to be more likely to follow common practices, such as asynchronous attribute methods for ads
  - AD nodes did indeed have more async scripts

Content Features

- Domain Party
  - Expect AD nodes to be more likely to come from third-party domains than Non-AD nodes. Yes more than 90% came from third-party
- URL Length
  - Expect AD nodes to have a large number of query parameters in URLs. True on average.

### Implementation

ADGraph was implemented inside the browser, not an extension.

Implemented as an extension, using JS stack walking. This method takes a serious hit in recall.

- Blink instrumentation:
  - Instrument Blink to capture anytime a:
    - Network request is about to be sent
    - HTML node is created/modified
    - Control about to be passed to V8
  - Modified each page‚Äôs execution environment to bind the graph representation of the page to each page‚Äôs document object.
    - Allows to distinguish between scripts executing in different frames/sub-documents (difficult in prior works Section II-C)
  - Add instrumentation to allow to map between V8‚Äôs identifiers for script unites and the sources of script in the executing site (script tags, eval‚Äôed scripts, script by extensions)
- V8 Instrumentation:
  - Add points to allow to track anytime a script is compiled, anytime control changes between script units.
    - Done by associating every function and global scope to the script they‚Äôre compiled from. Then can note every time a new scope is entered and attribute any document modifications or network requests to that script until scope is exited.
