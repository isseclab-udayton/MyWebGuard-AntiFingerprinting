- [Who's in Control of YOur Control System?](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/who-control-your-control-system-device-fingerprinting-cyber-physical-systems.pdf)
  - Discusses two device fingerprinting techniques
  - 1: takes advantage of data acquisition funcs by monitoring the interaction between app layer responses and transport layer acks, obaining time measurements regarding the speed and workload. (meausring workload is concerning here as it may be consistent on ICS devices but not a typical desktop)
    - referred to as cross layer fingerprinting
  - 2: uses the control aspects of ICS environments to GENERATE signatures from the physical ops taken by the devices on the network. Essentially hardware fingerprinting.

## Testing Tools

Should use these to test implementation

- <https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/>
- <https://amiunique.org/>

## General Thoughts

- Should test effectiveness with testing tools and test site breakage as well
- Concept: users collectively identify unsafe data elements and report them to server. Server then considers all values from all users and if its all the same then it is considered safe.
  - Maybe dynamically create policies based on the values of many users?
- Idea: build a whitelist
  - Start by approving the original domain i.e. newyorktimes itself
  - Observe how other third party domains behave and if its not suspicious, then approve it.
  - Allows for strict rules for newer, not seen api’s but relaxed on well known ones
  - Perhaps a server to compare to other users stuff
- Option to pause blocking as banking/transaction companies use fingerprints in a good way
- Since balancing between security and usability can be difficult, perhaps there could be a “whats wrong with this web page” button where you can say “pictures not working” or “animations not working”.
