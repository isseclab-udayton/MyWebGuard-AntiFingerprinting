## Research Goals & Brainstorm

- Determine a list of fingerprinting vectors (apis)
  - Ensure to consider dynamic vs static approaches.
  - Many many more static approaches than dynamic ones.
- How to predict new vectors?
  - New software is developed all the time, as a result it is increasingy difficult to predict what API's or hardware will be vulnerable next.
  - Can we come up with a way to identify "challenges" created by JavaScript execution without knowing the exact API used?
    - Is there a common behavior among all these techniques?
      - Finding many time-based techniques: GPU, Link, etc.
