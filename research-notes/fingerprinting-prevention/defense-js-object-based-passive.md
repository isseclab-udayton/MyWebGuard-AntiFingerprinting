- Fingerprinting: “Browser fingerprinting is a mechanism that identifies and collects the attributes of a device and each of these attribute values are combined to generate a unique identifier for the related device which can be used for tracking purposes.
  - Unlike cookies, fingerprinting is unregulated and may happen without the user knowing
  - A stateless tracking technique, which makes it difficult for users themselves to block or opt out of like cookies
  - Usually motivated by a desire for delivering targeted services (ads)
- This paper uses API normalization, making unique values with generic ones to try to “blend in with the crowd”
- Found that 10.18% of Alexa top 100k uses fingerprinting techniques
- Passive Attributes used in fingerprinting:
  - These are usually able to be observed passively from network traffic
  - Computer make and model
  - HTTP header data – Most common passive fingerprinting method
  - OS version
  - Browser version
  - Time zone
  - Language settings
  - Hardware/Tech specs (CPU, GPU, Hard disk, Screen size, Resolution, etc.)
- Active Attributes used in fingerprinting:
  - These are generated characteristics using browser elements
  - JavaScript, Flash, other plugins
- Existing protection mechanisms:
  - Normalize the return values of JavaScript APIs
  - Randomize the return values of JavaScript APIs
  - Use heuristics to find and block fingerprinting scripts
- Some fingerprinting mitigation techniques are weak as they don’t change everything (ex: navigator.user agent needs to change HTTP header and javascript object)
  - Here, a fingerprinting algorithm would be able to tell that the user changed this property, rendering mitigation efforts futile
- Fingerprinting Techniques:
  - Canvas fingerprinting
    - Already discussed elsewhere…
  - WebGL fingerprinting
    - A graphics api that can render interactive 3D objects and manipulate them with javascript
    - Unique fingerprints rely on the distinct renders produced.
  - AudioContext fingerprinting
    - Must be started with user input, button click, screen swipe, etc.?
    - Known to be stable over time?
    - Similar to canvas fingerprinting, differences in hardware and software stack on the device yield differences in the processed audio signals.
  - JavaScript Object-based fingerprinting
    - Unmasking of browser attributes with the help of JavaScript properties
    - Done via navigator objects and screen objects
    - Navigator Objects: Browser information (vendor, version, js enabled, online status, plugins, etc.)
    - Screen Objects: Display config information (resolution, color depth, etc.)
- This paper normalizes javascript object-based fingerprinting values to make users more generic (similar to tor and brave)
  - Also spoofs http header data
