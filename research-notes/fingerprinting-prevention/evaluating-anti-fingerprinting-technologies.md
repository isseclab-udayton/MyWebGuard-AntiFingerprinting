# Evaluating Anti-Fingerprinting Privacy Enhancing Technologies

<https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3308558.3313703>

Hybrid method of analyzing Anti-Fingerprinting Privacy Enhancing Technologies (AFPETs)

- Theoretical or experimental analysis that directly looks at ability to mask attributes
  - PETInspector
    - Fingerprinting server
    - Client sim
    - Analysis engine
  - Does not require access to source code
  - Useful for new applications with no user base
- Context-Dependent or observational analysis
  - Usually difficult as too few users in database
  - FPInspector â€“ simulates a tracker and computes anonymity statistics
